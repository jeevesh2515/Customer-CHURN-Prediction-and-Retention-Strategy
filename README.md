🎯 Overview
This project develops a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry. By analyzing customer demographics, service usage patterns, and billing data, the system identifies at-risk customers and provides actionable retention strategies.
Key Achievement: 96% prediction accuracy with Random Forest, significantly outperforming industry benchmarks.
✨ Key Features

High-Performance ML Pipeline: 96% accuracy with Random Forest algorithm
Model Interpretability: SHAP and LIME integration for transparent predictions
Data Preprocessing: Advanced techniques including SMOTE for class imbalance
Multiple Model Comparison: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM
Feature Engineering: Comprehensive analysis of churn predictors
Business Recommendations: Data-driven retention strategies
